# Stack (Data Structure)

## What is a Stack?
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.

## Basic Operations
- Push → Insert element on top  
- Pop → Remove top element  
- Peek / Top → View top element  
- isEmpty → Check if stack is empty  

## Working Principle
The last element added is the first one to be removed.

## Real-Life Examples
- Undo/Redo in editors  
- Function call stack  
- Browser back button  

## Time Complexity
- Push: O(1)  
- Pop: O(1)  
- Peek: O(1)  

## Implementation
Can be implemented using:
- Array
- Linked List
