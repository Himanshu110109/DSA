# Queue (Data Structure)

## What is a Queue?
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows **FIFO (First In, First Out)** order.

## Basic Operations
- Enqueue → Insert element at the rear  
- Dequeue → Remove element from the front  
- Front → View first element  
- isEmpty → Check if queue is empty  

## Working Principle
The first element added is the first one to be removed.

## Real-Life Examples
- Printer job scheduling  
- CPU task scheduling  
- Ticket booking systems  

## Time Complexity
- Enqueue: O(1)  
- Dequeue: O(1)  
- Front: O(1)  

## Implementation
Can be implemented using:
- Array
- Linked List
- Circular Queue
