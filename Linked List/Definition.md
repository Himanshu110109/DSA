# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements (called nodes) are stored in separate memory locations, and each node contains data and a reference to the next node, allowing the list to grow or shrink dynamically without shifting elements in memory.

It is often more efficient than a normal (array-based) list for insertion and deletion operations because elements do not need to be shifted in memory only the links between nodes are updated.
