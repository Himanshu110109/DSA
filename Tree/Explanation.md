# Tree (Data Structure)

## What is a Tree?
A Tree is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes connected by edges. It starts with a root node, and every node can have zero or more child nodes. Unlike linear data structures like arrays or linked lists, a tree represents data in a parent-child hierarchy, which makes it useful for modeling real-world relationships.

## Basic Terms
- Root → Top node  
- Parent → Node with children  
- Child → Node below a parent  
- Leaf → Node with no children  
- Height → Longest path from node to a leaf  

## Types of Trees
- Binary Tree  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- AVL Tree  
- Heap  
- Trie  

## Real-Life Examples
- File system folders  
- HTML DOM  
- Organization hierarchy  

## Time Complexity (Balanced BST)
- Search: O(log n)  
- Insert: O(log n)  
- Delete: O(log n)  

## Implementation
Trees are usually implemented using nodes that store a value and references to their child nodes.
