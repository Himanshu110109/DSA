# Binary Tree (DSA)

A **Binary Tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, called the **left child** and **right child**.

It is used to represent structured data and is the foundation of many important trees like Binary Search Tree, Heap, and Expression Trees.

### Key Points:
- Each node has at most two children.
- The top node is called the **root**.
- Nodes with no children are called **leaf nodes**.
- Used in searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation.

### Common Uses:
- Binary Search Trees for fast lookup
- Heaps for priority queues
- Expression trees in compilers
