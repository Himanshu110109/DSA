# Bubble Sort

## What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## How it works:
- Compare adjacent elements.
- Swap them if the first is greater than the second.
- Repeat this process for each pass.
- After each pass, the largest element moves to its correct position at the end.

## Example:
Input:  [5, 1, 4, 2]
Pass 1 → [1, 4, 2, 5]
Pass 2 → [1, 2, 4, 5]

## Time Complexity:
- Best case: O(n) (already sorted)
- Worst case: O(n²)
- Average case: O(n²)

## Space Complexity:
- O(1) (in-place sorting)

## Advantages:
- Simple to understand and implement  
- No extra memory needed  

## Disadvantages:
- Very slow for large datasets  
- Not used in real-world applications
