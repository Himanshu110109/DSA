# Graph — Data Structure

## Definition
A graph is a non-linear data structure used to represent relationships between objects.

It is made of:
- Vertices (nodes)
- Edges (connections)

---

## Types of Graphs
- Directed graph — connections have direction  
- Undirected graph — connections have no direction  
- Weighted graph — connections have values  
- Unweighted graph — connections have no values  

---

## Traversal
Traversal is the process of visiting all nodes.

- **BFS (Breadth First Search)**: visits level by level  
- **DFS (Depth First Search)**: goes deep before backtracking  

---

## Applications
- Maps and navigation
- Social networks
- Computer networks
- Dependency management

---

## Advantages
- Models relationships well
- Used in many real systems

## Disadvantages
- Can be complex for large data
- Needs careful implementation

---

## Conclusion
Graphs are useful when data is connected and relationships matter.
