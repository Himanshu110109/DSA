## Recursion

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems.

### Key Components
- **Base Case**: The condition where the function stops calling itself.
- **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller input.

### How It Works
1. Function is called with an input.
2. If the base case is met → return result.
3. Otherwise → call the same function with a reduced problem.
4. Results are returned back step by step.
